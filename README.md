## Overview

Baseline is a PowerShell-based utility for configuring, debloating, tuning, and hardening supported Windows installations.

It includes:

- a desktop GUI with search, filters, risk labels, and preset selection
- headless execution for scripted or repeatable runs
- modular manifests for tweaks, metadata, and presets
- logging, validation, and metadata tooling for maintainability
- coverage across privacy, telemetry, security, Defender, UI, taskbar, Start menu, OneDrive, UWP apps, networking, gaming, and system behavior

## Supported operating systems

Baseline supports **PowerShell 5.1** on:

- **Windows 10**: 2019 to current, **x86 / x64 / ARM64**

## Getting started

### Local launch

```powershell
.\run.cmd
```

### Direct PowerShell launch

```powershell
.\Win10_11Util.ps1
```

### Headless / noninteractive run

```powershell
.\Win10_11Util.ps1 -Functions "DiagTrackService -Disable", "DiagnosticDataLevel -Minimal", "UninstallUWPApps"
```

### Interactive session / tab completion

```powershell
. .\Completion\Interactive.ps1
```

## Remote bootstrap

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdmanson8/Win10_11Util/main/Bootstrap/Bootstrap.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

The bootstrap flow downloads the repository archive, extracts it to a temporary folder, and launches the standard entry point.

## Presets

Baseline ships with four built-in presets:

- **Minimal** — smallest baseline of practical quality-of-life and maintenance tweaks
- **Safe** — lower-risk usability, privacy, and cleanup recommendations
- **Balanced** — broader privacy, performance, and system configuration changes
- **Aggressive** — advanced tuning, debloat, and hardening for experienced users

## Developer tooling

### Validate manifest ownership / duplicates

```powershell
pwsh -File .\Tools\Validate-ManifestData.ps1
```

### Add generated metadata to manifests

## Notes

- Baseline is intended for users who want explicit control over Windows behavior.
- Some tweaks may require administrator rights.
- Some tweaks may require a restart to fully apply.
- Higher-risk and advanced changes should be reviewed carefully before use.
